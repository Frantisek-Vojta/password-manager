# Password Manager - Beta Version

This is a **Password Manager** project currently in **Beta**. I am working on it and will finish the final touches within the next weekend.

## Features:
- Store your passwords securely on your local machine.
- All passwords are **hashed** and stored on your PC, **no data is sent anywhere**.
- You can easily manage and retrieve your stored passwords via a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Designed with **JavaFX** and developed in **Java 21** for improved performance and security.

## Development Status:
- This is still a **Beta version** and is under active development.
- The final version will include additional features and bug fixes.

## Compatibility:
- This version has been developed and tested on **Linux**.
- It is currently **uncertain** whether it will work on **Windows** or **macOS**, as I am yet to test it on these operating systems.

## Security:
- Your passwords are securely stored **locally on your computer**.
- **Passwords are hashed** using a strong hashing algorithm, ensuring that even if your storage is compromised, the original passwords remain secure.
- **No data is sent** to external servers, making it a completely offline solution.

## How to Use:
1. Download the project files.
2. Compile the project using **Java 21**.
3. Run the application and create a new password database.
4. Add new credentials (username, email, password).
5. Retrieve your stored passwords when needed.

## Roadmap:
- Add **cross-platform support** (testing on Windows and macOS).
- Improve **user interface** and experience.
- Implement **backup and restore** functionality for password databases.

Feel free to fork the project and make contributions. Issues and pull requests are welcome.
